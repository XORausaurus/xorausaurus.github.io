# Bashfuscator
Bashfuscator is a modular and extendable Bash obfuscation framework written in Python 3. It provides numerous different ways of making Bash one-liners or scripts much more difficult to understand. It accomplishes this by generating convoluted, randomized Bash code that at runtime evaluates to the original input and executes it. Bashfuscator makes generating highly obfuscated Bash commands and scripts easy, both from the command line and as a Python library.

It is HIGHLY useful on most red-teaming operations, and i highly encourage people to obfuscate their trace as much as they can, using obfuscated scripts is a good starting step.

*Note that everytime you run the program you will have a newly random generated obfuscated bash script, if you want a small one you may have to run bashfuscator multiple times until you have a payload with the size you want.*

Bashfuscator can be found on github at the following [link](https://github.com/Bashfuscator/Bashfuscator).
